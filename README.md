# Surivor-TV-series-Players---EDA-Modelling

This project contains Exploratory Data Analysis of Survivor contestants' particulars. 

I set out to discover the homestates of contestants, but eventually expanded my exploration to other characteristics including age distribution, sex, and mode of applications to the show. I also tried to model the final positions of contestants and the odds of getting the right to become jury members. The first part of this project includes the full documentation for data munging.
